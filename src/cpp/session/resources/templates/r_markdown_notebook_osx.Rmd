This is an R Markdown Notebook.

When you execute R code inside the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. Try executing this chunk by placing your cursor inside it and pressing **Cmd+Shift+Enter**, or clicking the Run icon in the upper right.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Add a new chunk here with **Cmd+Option+I**, or use the Add Chunk ("+C") icon on the editor toolbar.
