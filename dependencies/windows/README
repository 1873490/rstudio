Install Required Applications
=============================================================================

Building RStudio requires installations of a number of applications 
(including R). These applications include:

R:         http://www.r-project.org/ 
CMake:     http://www.cmake.org/ (choose "Add to system path" during install)
Java:      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads
Ant:       http://code.google.com/p/winant
NSIS:      http://nsis.sourceforge.net

Installing QT
=============================================================================

Qt installation involves both the Qt SDK and MinGW compiler
as well as version Qt 5.2 of the Qt Framework. First, install
Qt 5.2 rc1 from this URL:

http://download.qt-project.org/snapshots/qt/5.2/5.2.0-rc1/2013-11-27_177/qt-windows-opensource-5.2.0-rc1-mingw48_opengl-x86-offline_2013-11-27_11-26-05-177.exe

Note that Mingw 4.8 is not installed by default so you need to
be sure to select it under Tools in the installer target 
customization UI.

Update System Path
=============================================================================

Building RStudio requires that the CMake, Qt, and MingGW executables be 
accessible via the system path (note that CMake should already be accessible
via the CMake installer if the "Add to system path" option was chosen during
installation). For Qt and MinGW you should ensure that the following 
additional directories are available on the path:

C:\Qt\Qt5.2.0\5.2.0-rc1\mingw48_32\bin
C:\Qt\Qt5.2.0\Tools\mingw48_32\bin

Finally, you should also ensure that your R installation's bin
directory is on the system path. For example:

C:\Program Files\R\R-2.15.1\bin\i386


Satisfy Additional Dependencies
=============================================================================

Additional dependencies (boost, mingw64, GWT, and gin) can be satisfied by
running the following script:

install-dependencies.cmd

NOTE: How to upgrade boost-1.50-win-gcc48.zip
=============================================================================

boost-1.50-win-gcc48.zip is a prepackaged set of boost 1.50 windows headers and
binaries (32 and 64 bit) built for MinGW 4.8. To upgrade to either a new
boost or MinGW version you should download the appropriate boost windows
source archive, boostrap the boost build system (note that this
requires MSFT Visual C++) then follow the instructions below 

Win32
---------

(ensure 32 bit mingw is in the path)

bjam --prefix=C:\boost32 toolset=gcc address-model=32 ^ 
 variant=debug,release link=static threading=multi ^ 
 install

Win64
--------- 

(ensure 64 bit mingw is in the path) 

bjam --prefix=C:\boost64 toolset=gcc address-model=64 ^
     --with-date_time --with-filesystem --with-iostreams ^
     --with-program_options --with-regex --with-signals ^ 
     --with-system --with-thread --with-chrono ^ 
     variant=debug,release link=static threading=multi ^ 
     install


Note the additional define of BOOST_USE_WINDOWS_H required for the 64 bit build 

After this you can create a new boost-win.zip archive using the contents
of the C:\boost32 and C:\boost64 directories.


NOTE: Getting boost to work with mingw64
=============================================================================

See the following article for general approach/guidelines:

http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mingw-w64/wiki/Building%20Boost

In order to build rstudio with boost under win32 we had to apply the 
following patch (so that boost can correctly detect mingw64 as distinct
from another mingw distribution:

https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/changeset/79334

This should be fixed in more recent versions of boost, see:

https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4258

Note that in order to build rstudio with boost under win64 we had to make
the following additional accomodations:

1) define BOOST_USE_WINDOWS_H to eliminate errors compiling boost::thread
   (see thread: http://lists.boost.org/boost-users/2010/02/55945.php)

2) #undef BOOST_USE_WINDOWS_H prior to including <boost/interprocess/*>
within BoostErrors.hpp

3) add a dummy definitions for boost::thread::tss_cleanup_implemented
   (see ticket: https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4258)
