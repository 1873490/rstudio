Install Required Applications
=============================================================================

Building RStudio requires installations of a number of applications 
(including R). These applications include:

R:         http://www.r-project.org/ 
CMake:     http://www.cmake.org/ (choose "Add to system path" during install)
QtForWin:  https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-buildtools/QtSdk-online-win-x86-v1_2_1.exe
Java:      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads
Ant:       http://code.google.com/p/winant
NSIS:      http://nsis.sourceforge.net


Update System Path
=============================================================================

Building RStudio requires that the CMake, Qt, and MinGW executables be 
accessible via the system path (note that CMake should already be accessible
via the CMake installer if the "Add to system path" option was chosen during
installation). For Qt and MinGW you should ensure that the following additional 
directories are available on the path:

C:\Qt\4.8.3\bin
C:\Qt\Qt5.0.2\Tools\MinGW\bin

Finally, you should also ensure that your R installation's bin directory is
on the system path.


Satisfy Additional Dependencies
=============================================================================

Additional dependencies (boost, mingw64, GWT, and gin) can be satisfied by
running the following script:

install-dependencies.cmd
